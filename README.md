# SortViz

**(WORK IN PROGRESS)**

> LIVE: https://sortviz.herokuapp.com

A web application to visualize popular sorting algorithms in action

## Todo

This project is still in very early stages of development. I will come back to this project after completing another high-priority project of mine. I have the following things in mind to add in future:

-   Add QuickSort, BubbleSort, HeapSort
-   Improve the current user interface
-   Add more subtle visualizations with different colors (like which part of the array is sorted etc)
